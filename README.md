# **XR Based Shopping Kiosk using Planogram**

The *XR-Based Shopping Kiosk* using Planogram is an exciting project that combines **extended reality (XR) technology** with *planogram visualization* to revolutionize the shopping experience. By wearing **VR headsets**, customers will be able to view a *virtual representation* of a retail store. The kiosk will leverage **planogram data**, which is a visual representation of how products should be displayed on store shelves, to recreate a virtual store environment. The planogram data will be generated using *previous sales data analytics* of the store.
